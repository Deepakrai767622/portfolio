        UX (User Experience) design is the process of creating products, systems or services that provide meaningful and
        relevant experiences to users. This involves the design of the entire process of acquiring and integrating the
        product, including aspects of branding, design, usability, and function. It also includes meaningful and
        valuable aspects of human-computer interaction and product ownership. UX handles the architecture of the content
        and the sitemap.

        As a spoiler, we’d like to say that UI (User Interface) design, we’ll talk about in the next part, is an
        important aspect of UX design, it is a subset of it. Because UX design covers a vast array of other areas.
        Information Architecture (IA) is the second most viable aspect of UX design.</p>

    <p>The main task of UX design is to create products which can be tailored to meet a user’s specific needs, but which
        provides functionality that is predictable. In other words, UX Design is to study user behavior and understand
        user motivations with the goal to design better digital experiences.</p>
