        JavaScript is used for making web-pages “alive” and interactive. Programs, written with JavaScript are called
        scripts. Since scripts are directly connected to HTML, they are immediately executed as soon as the page is
        loaded in your browser. Truth be told, scripts are the plain text. That means they don’t need any additional or
        preliminary development. And this feature is what differs JavaScript from Java programming language.</p>

    <p>Why is it called JavaScript, you may ask. At the very beginning, it had an alternative name – LiveScript. But at
        that time, Java was very popular as a programming language and marketers decided to create the similar naming in
        order to attract more users. Planned to be a part of Java, JS was growing rapidly and now became an independent
        programming language with its own ECMAScript specification.</p>

    <p>Modern JavaScript is a safe and secure programming language. Partly because it does not provide low-level tools
        and does not have access to low-level resources like working with memory or processor. In fact, JS was initially
        focused on browsers and interaction within browsers only. And the browser space is separated from OS, that’s why
        JavaScript is playing on the safe side.</p>
